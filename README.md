# LungDiseasePredictionfromX-rayImagesUsingAttentionGuidedConvolutionalNeuralNetwork
In this project, we implemented an Attention-Guided Convolutional Neural Network (AG-CNN) to perform disease diagnosis classification on chest X-ray images. The AG-CNN architecture consists of three branches: the Global Branch, the Local Branch, and the Fusion Branch.
